## Project Description

One & All is a social networking app designed to help new immigrants from Hong Kong connect with each other and build relationships through real-life events. Users can easily create posts with their event ideas and set a minimum number of joiners to turn their idea into an actual event. The app also offers gender-specific events for users looking for a real-life dating experience.
